            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <p>So, I am currently doing work in Software Developer domain, also doing some works in different domains too. Engineering was always a passion for me as it opens the door to a new world where a person meets the future that's why i decided to pursue Engineering as my carrier. From the beginningg I was always curious for new things and in engineering I found there is day to day innovations and some new technology along with research we get to know that's tthe most exciting part of engineering, we always get exposed to something new to discover and learn skills as well as knowledge. My luck or what can I say I wasn't prepared upto the mark and I didn't make to clear JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) in my first attempt and took admission in srm ghaziabad. Well, I didn't seen it as a failure as it boosted my will and I took as a challenge to qualify JEE and fortunately, I cracked it although from srm too, I have learnt some skills like I learnt german with a good proficiency, AUTOCaD fluently and c language and from there only, I started my journey of coding. It was a challenging time and fortunately,I learnt from that phase and came out of that. I have proficiency in some languages like c, c++, python and Java as in my 3rd semester I have done Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with the help of Python and it's libraries. In the 2nd semester, I have done MATLAB as part of my course and in 4th semester I have completed Java as part of my lab course. Along with all these paralelly I have been doing Data Structures and Algorithm and Web-Development. I am too much curious about the current AI technologies that made me to explore prompt engineering. Previously when I was preparing for my JEE, I have explored game development too as I was doing a course of cs50x Harvard University program in that and made my first project that was Super Mario 3D game using gaming engine and I got exposed to I have created some projects in game development too with my team that was Super Mario 3D game. Although I am currently focusing specefically in my domain only. But, yeah I have a principle from gathering knowledge or skills from wherever I can find it. Currently, I am looking to refine my skills as I have theoretical knowledge but want to implement it too. So, thats all from my side........... Thank You & Have a great day :)</p>
